# Pokemon-Card
Pokemon-Card

This project is made for "JS Fundamentals cours" - Telecom Academy.
It was a good excercise for working with JS requests -  asyncron programming.
I used:
- Java Scripts (asyncron programming, requests, fetch, async, await, catch errors, variables, functions, decisional structure, repetitive structure, class, objects, arrays, querySelector, addEventListener, ),
- HTML (create structure with diffrent tags, link css file, link script js file)
- CSS concepts (applaying style at general level, at class level, at id level, display flex, dispaly grip, border, size, color, background, import font family).

The result is a dinamic card, generated for a certain pokemon. The card has detailed info about the pokemon and it is base on requests.
